# Lab 10: CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and SonarQube


## Introduction
This lab demonstrates how to automate the build, test, and code quality analysis of a Java application using Jenkins and SonarQube. By the end, you will have a working pipeline that checks your code for errors and quality issues every time you push changes.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic knowledge of Java and Maven
- Familiarity with Jenkins and SonarQube concepts

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Lab10
   ```
2. **Start Jenkins and SonarQube using Docker Compose**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. **Access Jenkins**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Complete the initial setup and install recommended plugins
4. **Access SonarQube**
   - Go to `http://localhost:9000`
   - Log in with default credentials (admin/admin)
5. **Configure Jenkins Pipeline**
   - Create a new pipeline job
   - Use the provided `jenkinsfile` for pipeline configuration
6. **Run the Pipeline**
   - Trigger a build and observe the stages: build, test, and code analysis

## Jenkins Pipeline Overview
The Jenkins pipeline defined in `jenkinsfile` automates the following tasks:
- Build the Java application using Maven
- Run unit tests
- Analyze code quality with SonarQube
- Archive build artifacts

## SonarQube Integration
SonarQube is used to analyze the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. The pipeline sends analysis results to SonarQube, which you can review in the SonarQube dashboard.

## Screenshots
Below are screenshots showing the setup and results at each stage:

## Troubleshooting
- If Jenkins or SonarQube do not start, check Docker logs for errors.
- Ensure ports 8080 (Jenkins) and 9000 (SonarQube) are not in use by other applications.
- If SonarQube analysis fails, verify the SonarQube server URL and authentication token in Jenkins.

## Conclusion
You have now set up a basic CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and SonarQube for a Java application. This setup can be extended to include more advanced features like deployment, notifications, and additional quality gates.

Feel free to experiment and modify the pipeline to suit your project needs. Happy coding!
